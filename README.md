#Welcome
This repository contains an empirical economic analysis of the relationship between education levels and labor participation rates (LFPR) across the 50 states + DC from 2010-2018. By employing fixed-effects regressions to the combined FRED and US Cenus Bureau data sets, I analyze the intra-state and inter-state correlations between my two variables of focus as a part of my first academic exploration of applied econometrics. While limited in scope, resources, and availability of larger datasets, this project provided an extensive introduction to the tools that I hope to carry deep into a career in economic research, utlizing numerous python libraries, R, Tableau, terminal / git, and LaTex while allowing me to further develop my interest in the intersection of development and labor economics with data science.

# Repository Structure
In the 'analysis' folder, you will find my jupyter notebook program and my data analysis conducted in R; the results of these programs can be seen in the 'outputs' folder. In 'data' you will find the FRED and US Census Bureau data that I scraped and organized via python, merging each state's monthly data from the two series into a  'merged_state_panel' that I proceeded to focus my analysis on. Currently still in progress is my formalized report of the findings, being compiled in LaTex. I expect this to be completed in the upcoming few weeks.
